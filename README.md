# MacroKeyboard
This is a small macro keyboard made with Arduino and including a few different 3d printable case options, the motherboard fits into either case and secures with 4 x M1.4 5-millimeter screws

The cases are angled at 7.5 degrees to match the standard angle of a mechanical keyboard. The Horizontal variant is meant to be placed behind the keyboard, behind the F keys. The Vertical variant is designed to be placed to the right OR left of the keyboard.

The logic board must be installed into the case before the switches are soldered in.

**Component List:**

1x Arduino Pro Micro 

4 x M1.4 5-millimeter screws

8x Cherry MX-compatible keyswitches

8x Cherry MX-compatible keycaps
