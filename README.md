# MacroKeyboard
This is a small macro keyboard made with Arduino and including a few different 3d printable case options, the logic board fits into either case and secures with 4 x M1.4 5-millimeter screws.

Logic board was created with KiCAD. 

The cases are angled at 7.5 degrees to match the standard angle of a keyboard. The Horizontal variant is designed to be placed behind the keyboard, behind the F keys. The Vertical variant is designed to be placed to the right or left of the keyboard.

The logic board must be installed into the case before the switches are soldered in.

**Component List:**

1x Arduino Pro Micro 

4 x M1.4 5-millimeter screws

8x Cherry MX-compatible keyswitches

8x Cherry MX-compatible keycaps

8x 10k ohm through-hole resistor

**Folder Structure:** 
Case3DModels: Includes the STL files required to 3D print the two case options.
Code: Includes the Arduino code required to flash the firmware.
KicadProjectFiles: All files required by KiCAD to open the logic board files. Can be used to generate gerbers for sending to fab house.
Pics: A few pictures of the project and included assets.
